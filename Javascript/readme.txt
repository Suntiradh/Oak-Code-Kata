Freecodecamp Javascript practice conclusion: From the lessons learned which consist of

1.Basic JavaScript
2.ES6
3.Debugging
4.Basic Data Structures
5.Basic Algorithm Scripting
6.Object Oriented Programming

I have practiced and understand many different syntax and conditions of use and I think the key is to practice basic Javascript tightly in order to develop a base of knowledge. And continue to create work for the future.
