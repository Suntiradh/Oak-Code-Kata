        With rigor and wit, <u>Dawkins</u>  examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the <strong> <em>Old</em>  </strong> Testament, to the more benign (but still illogical) <strong><em>Celestial</em></strong>  Watchmaker favored by some <strong><em>Enlightenment</em></strong> thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the <strong><em>supreme</em></strong>  improbability of a <strong><em> supreme</em></strong> being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.
        <u>The God Delusion</u> makes a <strong><em>compelling</em></strong>  case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers <strong><em>exhilarating</em></strong> insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could <strong><em>ever</em></strong>  muster.
